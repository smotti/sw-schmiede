      <description>A cloud-backend on AWS for the consumer market product of MedicusTek.
Due to the nature of the data a strong focus on overall system security was required. Other quality attributes like reliability and availability were also very important because the product is used for real-time monitoring. Besides that there was one tough constraint, use as less AWS services as possible in order for the company to change cloud providers easily, if the need arises.</description>

      <description>Note this was done around two years ago, back then I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a similar setup in the CFE3 community or elsewhere.
Reading Mark Burgess&amp;rsquo;s book In Search of Certainty I got inspired to build a fully decentralized cloud infrastructure, with self-healing capabilities and that can scale to several thousand nodes, requiring as few administrators as possible (due to very limited human resources at the company I built it for).</description>

      <description>I received a Bachelor of Engineering degree, with focus on Information Technology and Distributed Systems. By now I have 4 years of experience in professional software development, system engineering and devops. Within those 4 years I&amp;rsquo;ve designed and build cloud-based and on-premise systems in the healthcare industry. Being in this industry also meant to have a strong focus towards quality and security.
I do embrace agile principles and practices, and highly value close cooperation with customers.</description>
